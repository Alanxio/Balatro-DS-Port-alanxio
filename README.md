## How to Install
1. Get MicroLUA from https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Micro_Lua_DS
2. Put the source code folder into lua/scripts/
3. To play in DeSmuME, navigate to Config > Slot 2 (GBA Slot)
4. From there change the drop down to Flash Card Device and the folder to the folder with MicroLua 4.7.2.nds

## Limits
The game lacks music, different decks, and only has 12 Boss Blinds and 15 Jokers. 

##  Improvements

Now system for finding what the current hand played is working! Now only the played hands will count meanwhile the other cards will be discarded whitout be added to the chips counter.

## Errors
The UI of the menu is a mess... Still working on it!
